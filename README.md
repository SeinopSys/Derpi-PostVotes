<h1 align="center">Derpi-PostVotes</h1>

Did you ever wish you could upvote a witty comment, or show just how much you dislike something someone said without having to type out a reply? Then look no further!

After the extension is installed every single forum post and comment will get a set of up- and downvote buttons with a score counter between them. The scores are updated live, and are visible to all users of this extension.

A [WebSocket server](https://github.com/SeinopSys/Derpi-PostVotes-Backend) is what stores the votes and serves the requests. This server operates entirely separate from Derpibooru. The buttons will only appear if the voting server is available. To prevent duplicate voting you can only see scores and cast votes while logged into a user account. See the [Privacy Policy](https://github.com/SeinopSys/Derpi-PostVotes-Backend/blob/master/PRIVACY_POLICY.md) for additional details.
